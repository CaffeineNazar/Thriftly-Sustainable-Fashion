# Desgin Aplikasi
Thriftly used Figma to create a second-hand online shopping app. The process started with understanding user needs and seeking inspiration from similar apps. Next, the design team created wireframes to determine the layout of each page.

After that, they focused on the UI design by choosing colors, fonts, and images that fit the thrifting theme. This design was made to be easy to use and attractive.  The next stage was to create an interactive prototype to see how the app works as a whole.

Finally, the design team conducted user testing to get feedback and make improvements. The key design principles are sustainable, simple, responsive, and inclusive. Thriftly builds apps in a structured way, starting from research, design, to testing, with the ultimate goal of creating apps that are useful and fun for users.

# Collaboration 
This project we combined 3 informatics diciplines that is MD, ML, and CC. To know more about the detail here is the provided work detail for each diciplines

#### Cloud Computing
Our team will design and implement the cloud infrastructure that powers the Thriftly application. We'll start by defining the architecture and estimating costs. Next, we'll set up the core services like databases and storage. We'll then develop and test APIs to ensure smooth communication between different parts of the system. Finally, we'll optimize performance, implement security measures, and deploy the infrastructure to the cloud.

- Planning: Determining needs, designing the cloud structure, and estimating costs.
- Development: Setting up basic cloud services, building databases, and developing APIs.
-  Testing: Testing all components to ensure performance and security.
- Optimization: Improving application performance and scalability.
-  Launch: Performing final preparations and launching the application.

###### Technology: 
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) will be the backbone of the system, with services such as Firestore, Cloud Storage, and Identity Platform.
###### Focus: Data security, high performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.
In essence, the project will build a robust cloud infrastructure to support the Thriftly app and ensure an optimal user experience.

***
#### Machine Learning

Our team will build a system that can provide appropriate product recommendations for each Thriftly user. The process will start by collecting and processing user data. Next, we'll build a smart computer model to learn users' buying patterns. This model will continue to learn and become more accurate over time.

###### In a nutshell, the steps are:
- Understanding needs: We will find out what kind of recommendations users want.
- Collecting data: We will collect data on products that users have seen, bought and liked.
- Modeling: We will build a computer model that can predict what products users will like.
- Testing and refining: We will continuously test and improve the model to make it more accurate.
- Combining with apps: We'll connect the model with the Thriftly app so users can instantly see product recommendations.
- Ultimate goal: Provide a more personalized and enjoyable shopping experience for Thriftly users.

In other words, we want to create a feature that guesses, “If you like this product, you'll probably like this product too.”
